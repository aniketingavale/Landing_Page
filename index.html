            a project where #MBsocialcar videographers and filmmakers have the opportunity to carry out their own ideas. Mercedes-Benz 
            supports the production of these episodes financially but also by providing vehicles. The artists get to determine the staging, 
            the model and the location. The result are unique episodes that are being published frequently on the official social 
            media channels of Mercedes-Benz like YouTube and Facebook. If you too have an idea for a video, please apply now at 
            socialmedia@daimler.com!</p></div>

            Mercedes-Benz AG is one of the world's largest manufacturers of luxury passenger cars. In 2020, it sold around 2.1 million passenger 
            cars and nearly 375,000 vans. In its two business segments, Mercedes-Benz AG is continually expanding its worldwide production network

        <div class="box-3">
            As sustainability is the guiding principle of the Mercedes-Benz strategy and for the company itself, this means creating lasting 
            value for all stakeholders: for customers, employees, investors, business partners and society as a whole. The basis for this is 
            Daimler’s sustainable business strategy. The company thus takes responsibility for the economic, ecological and social effects of 
            its business activities and looks at the entire value chain.
